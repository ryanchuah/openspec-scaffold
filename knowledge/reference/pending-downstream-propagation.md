# Pending downstream propagation (operator-gated)

Scaffold-managed changes propagate to downstream repos (`extrends`, `psc-monitor`) via
`scripts/sync_scaffold.py` — an **operator-gated** step, typically run as a batch. This ledger
records scaffold changes that shipped **locally** (to scaffold `main`, unpushed) but are **not yet
propagated**, plus any per-change caveat that matters at propagation time. It is per-repo state (not
scaffold-managed): each repo's propagation frontier differs, so this file does not itself propagate.

## Last full propagation — 2026-07-04 (both downstreams, local & unpushed)
- **extrends** — converged to scaffold HEAD (beacon `a879317`); audit layer wired. Data-lint stays
  off (repo DB is SQLite, blocked on the upstream `data_lint` SQLite backend —
  `knowledge/questions/data-lint-sqlite-backend.md`). Operator pruning of the relocated
  handoffs-archive dir + 2 untracked root handoff files still pending.
- **psc-monitor** — propagated (commit `0485daa`, beacon `511843b`); audit layer wired (4 Postgres
  `data-lint` invariants live). osv-scanner (no root lockfile) + deptry (no pip dev-extra) idle by
  choice.

Two scaffold fixes shipped **during** that propagation: the lint-knowledge removed-manifest
tombstone (`9ea6076`) and the ruff `target-version=py311` cross-repo determinism pin (`a879317`).

## Shipped since 2026-07-04 — NOT yet propagated (deferred, operator-gated)
All shipped to scaffold `main` locally (unpushed), awaiting a fresh operator propagation
authorization. Several arrive **INERT** on first sync (auto-disabled until a downstream repo opts
in), so batching them is low-risk:
- **correctness-audit-skill** (2026-07-13) — new skill + marker-gated dossier lint; INERT until a
  repo authors a marked dossier.
- **verify-stack-redirect** (2026-07-13) — manifest-tracked skill/agent/AGENTS.md edits. (Root
  `README.md`, not scaffold-managed, was reconciled directly — no downstream sweep.)
- **lesson-check-ratchet** (2026-07-13) — `repo_lint.py` / `knowledge_lint.py` ratchet checks + two
  skill triage steps; framework arrives INERT (no `checks/*.py`, no per-repo ledger → auto-disabled,
  lint-guarded); per-repo adoption is separate downstream SMALL work.
- **outstanding-and-continuity-hardening** (2026-07-13) — widened handoff-file lint; **coupled** to a
  downstream cleanup: extrends (~27) + psc-monitor handoff-named files must be renamed/archived
  first, else the widened lint reddens both repos' pytest gates. See
  `knowledge/questions/continuity-file-downstream-cleanup.md`.
- **lifecycle-skill-hardening** (2026-07-13) — scaffold-only SMALL lifecycle-skill fixes.
- **Wave-1/2 hardening batch** (2026-07-13/14) — `defect-prevention-detectors` (OW-1+4),
  `instruction-surface-coherence` (OW-9+14), `delegation-wrapper-telemetry` (OW-7),
  `apply-throughput-resume` (OW-10), `skill-debloat-gates` (OW-11 mechanized half), and
  `verify-adversarial-fixtures` — all edit scaffold-managed skills / config / detectors.
- **knowledge-surface-bounding-2** (2026-07-14) — `status_lint.py`, new `boot_surface_lint.py`,
  `scaffold_manifest.txt`. Downstream will **FAIL** `boot_surface_lint` on first sync (extrends is
  ~122KB boot surface today) — the intended signal; cleaning that up is separate downstream work.
- **delegated-context-caching** (2026-07-14) — AGENTS.md shared span (stability batch-edits note +
  the SMALL-premise reviewer prompt reshape) + the 3 delegating skills (apply/archive/propose prompt
  reshapes) + `_shared/delegation-harness.md` (new §(g) variable-last convention). All behavior-
  preserving prompt reshapes + doc conventions; low-risk to propagate, no new lint failures expected
  downstream.
- **correctness-audit-meta-hardening** (2026-07-14) — `scripts/knowledge_lint.py` +
  `scripts/test_knowledge_lint.py` (two new detectors: `audit-liveness`, `post-close-ledger-format`)
  and `.claude/skills/correctness-audit/SKILL.md` (liveness/status-marker prose, blind coverage-gap
  review step, scope-seeding checklist, post-close ledger step), plus the `correctness-audit` +
  `knowledge-lint` capability specs. Both new lint checks are guarded on the existing
  `format: correctness-audit/v1` charter marker, same idiom as the shipped `audit-dossier-lint`
  check — no new downstream lint failures expected on first sync. **Migration note for the
  propagate-scaffold operator:** a downstream repo whose marked dossier is genuinely still
  in-progress must add a `status:` line to that charter (`in-progress`/`closed`) and, if
  in-progress, an Active `knowledge/questions/INDEX.md` item — a one-time reconciliation the
  liveness check will otherwise (correctly) flag; this is intended behavior, not a regression.
- **product-audit-skill** (2026-07-14, OW-16) — new `.claude/skills/product-audit/SKILL.md`,
  `scripts/knowledge_lint.py` + `scripts/test_knowledge_lint.py` (one new guarded
  `claims-ledger-staleness` detector), `scripts/scaffold_manifest.txt` (+SKILL line), and
  `scripts/scaffold_lint.py` (`_NON_OPENSPEC_SKILL_TOKENS` +`product-audit`). The `product-audit` (new)
  and `knowledge-lint` (ADDED requirement) capability specs are golden-source-only (never synced). The
  new detector is guarded on the `format: product-audit/v1` claims-ledger marker — no downstream repo
  has a claims ledger yet, so **no new downstream lint failures on first sync**; a repo that later
  adopts the claims-ledger convention gets the staleness check automatically once the marker is present.
- **archive-mechanization** (2026-07-14, OW-12) — new scripts `scripts/apply_delta_spec.py` +
  `scripts/archive_move.py` + their tests (`scripts/test_apply_delta_spec.py`,
  `scripts/test_apply_delta_spec_adversarial.py`, `scripts/test_archive_move.py`), all added to
  `scripts/scaffold_manifest.txt`; rewired `.claude/skills/openspec-sync-specs/SKILL.md`,
  `.claude/skills/openspec-archive-change/SKILL.md`, and BOTH `archive-executor.md` bodies
  (`.claude/agents/` + `.opencode/agents/`) to promote-then-move via the new scripts. **Coupling
  note:** the rewired skills/executors REFERENCE `apply_delta_spec.py`/`archive_move.py`, and those
  scripts are in the manifest, so a sync delivers both together — no broken reference downstream.
  The `archive-mechanization` capability spec (`openspec/specs/archive-mechanization/spec.md`) is
  golden-source-only (never synced). Stdlib-only, no new downstream lint/test failures expected on
  first sync. NOT yet synced to extrends/psc-monitor (operator-gated).
- **skill-debloat-residual** (2026-07-14, OW-11 residual) — new `scripts/freeze_check.py` +
  `scripts/test_freeze_check.py` (both added to `scripts/scaffold_manifest.txt`); `scripts/checks.py`
  (new `notes-checkpoint-structure` builtin + `--check` output-dir default to `output/checks/`) and
  `scripts/test_checks.py`; three skills (`.claude/skills/openspec-verify-change/SKILL.md` — de-bloat
  coverage steps + notes-checkpoint wiring + step-18 replacement, `.claude/skills/openspec-propose/SKILL.md`
  — freeze-check wiring + strict `VERDICT:` token in the reviewer prompt, `.claude/skills/openspec-explore/SKILL.md`
  — gallery trim); `.opencode/agents/openspec-reviewer.md` (emits the strict `VERDICT:` token — no
  `.claude/agents/` counterpart exists for this agent). The `defect-prevention-detectors` (ADDED
  requirement) and `premise-review-gate` (MODIFIED requirement) capability specs are golden-source-only,
  same as every `openspec/specs/` file — `sync_scaffold.py` only propagates manifest-listed
  skills/scripts/config, never spec files. Stdlib-only script changes; `test_checks.py` already passes
  `--out` explicitly so the output-dir default change breaks no existing test. NOT yet synced to
  extrends/psc-monitor (operator-gated).

## Scanner provisioning gaps (parked)
Surfaced while extrends/psc enabled scanners; see `knowledge/questions/scanner-provisioning-gaps.md`:
`install-tools.sh` gitleaks `go install` embeds no version (fails the `checks.py` version pin);
`$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is not on the non-interactive PATH. Deterministic-audit runbook:
`knowledge/reference/audit-runbook.md`.
